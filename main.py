# The challenge is to build a HTTP-based RESTful API for managing Short URLs and redirecting clients similar to bit.ly or goo.gl. Be thoughtful that the system must eventually support millions of short urls. Please include a README with documentation on how to build, and run and test the system. Clearly state all assumptions and design decisions in the README.
# A Short Url:
#
# 1. Has one long url
#
# 2. Permanent; Once created
#
# 3. Is Unique; If a long url is added twice it should result in two different short urls.
#
# 4. Not easily discoverable; incrementing an already existing short url should have a low probability of finding a working short url.
#
# Your solution must support:
#
# 1. Generating a short url from a long url
#
# 2. Redirecting a short url to a long url within 10 ms.
#
# 3. Listing the number of times a short url has been accessed in the last 24 hours, past week and all time.
#
# 4. Persistence (data must survive computer restarts)
#
# Shortcuts
#
# 1. No authentication is required
#
# 2. No html, web UI is required
#
# 3. Transport/Serialization format is your choice, but the solution should be testable via curl
